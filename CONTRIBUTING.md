# Contributing to Project WARLOCK

Thanks for your interest in building the future of tactical AR!

This is an open source project. We're building hardware, software, and documentation together as a community.

## How to Contribute

### Found a Bug?
Open an issue with:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your hardware/software setup

### Have an Idea?
Open an issue to discuss it first. Let's talk through the approach before you spend time coding.

### Want to Submit Code?
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/cool-thing`)
3. Make your changes
4. Test it works
5. Commit with a clear message
6. Push and open a pull request

### Building Hardware?
Share your build! We want to see:
- Photos of your setup
- Parts you used (if different from BOM)
- What worked and what didn't
- Any modifications you made

### Writing Documentation?
Documentation contributions are gold. Help us:
- Fix typos and unclear instructions
- Add troubleshooting tips
- Create assembly guides with photos
- Write tutorials

## Code Style

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8
- Comment your code
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable names

**Hardware:**
- Document part numbers and sources
- Include photos or diagrams
- Note any safety considerations
- Share CAD files if you design mounts/cases

**Documentation:**
- Write clearly and concisely
- Include examples
- Add screenshots/photos where helpful
- Test your instructions by following them

## Testing

Before submitting:
- Run your code and verify it works
- Test on actual hardware when possible
- Check that documentation is accurate
- Make sure you haven't broken existing features

## Communication

- **Discord:** [https://discord.gg/uFMEug4Bb9](https://discord.gg/uFMEug4Bb9) - Daily chat, questions, sharing builds
- **GitHub Issues:** Technical discussions, bug reports, feature requests
- **Pull Requests:** Code reviews and merge discussions

## What We're Looking For

**Right now (Phase 0-1):**
- Testing the basic detection script
- Improving the detection accuracy
- Raspberry Pi 5 setup scripts
- Low-light camera optimization
- Assembly documentation

**Soon:**
- Hardware mount designs
- Power optimization
- HUD rendering code
- Field testing feedback
